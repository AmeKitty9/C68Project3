            Originally the Canning Bridge School established in 1936, was renamed <strong>Manning Primary</strong> in 1951. In 2015, it became an Independent Public School.<br>
            Facilities, on the 6.4 hectare spacious grounds, include air conditioned and gas heated classrooms, a large oval, cricket pitch, tennis, basketball and netball courts and a small adventure playground. We have a covered assembly area for cultural and sporting events, a music room, and automated library.

        The canteen is open on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. Orders are placed before school and delivered to the class at lunch time.
        We strive to supply healthy food options in line with the State Canteen Associations guide lines and this year we have focused more on homemade food. 
        The school employs one person to run the canteen and all other staff are volunteers from the school community.  The volunteer hours are split into two shifts 8.30am-11.00am and 11.00am-1.00pm.  The successful running of the canteen relies heavily on parent help/volunteers.

        The library is a wonderful and quiet place to read books for your dream. 
        There are a lot of interesting things to read in the library.
        The school's student committee members film their video called "Manning on Mondays" in the library last year.
        The library was recently renovated and a classroom was added to put the increasing number of students.
